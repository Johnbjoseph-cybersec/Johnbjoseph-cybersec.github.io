🛡️ GRC Practice Lab
From Theory to Real-World GRC Execution

A browser-based, hands-on Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) simulation platform designed to help professionals practice real workflows — not just memorize frameworks.

Built by John B Joseph

🚀 Why This Platform Exists

Most GRC learning today is:

Theory-heavy

Certification-focused

Tool-dependent

Not portfolio-friendly

You can pass ISO 27001.
You can memorize SOC 2.

But can you:

Build a structured risk register?

Map controls properly?

Defend evidence during an audit?

Explain residual risk to leadership?

This lab bridges that gap.

🎯 What You Can Do Inside the Lab

Inside the GRC Practice Lab, users can:

Build structured Risk Registers

Map Controls to Risks

Generate Statement of Applicability (SoA)

Track and score Evidence

Simulate Audit Workflows

Run full SOC 2 / ISO-style Projects

Visualize Inherent vs Residual Risk

Use an integrated GRC AI Copilot

All directly in the browser.

✔ No installation
✔ No signup
✔ No backend
✔ No cloud database
✔ 100% client-side execution

All data stays local in your browser.

⚡ GRC AI Agent (WebGPU + WebLLM Powered)

Version 3 introduces a fully integrated on-device GRC AI Agent built using:

WebGPU

WebLLM

Local model inference

Embedded knowledge retrieval

This is not a generic chatbot.

It is a scoped GRC copilot that understands:

Your risks

Your controls

Your evidence

Your framework mappings

Your project structure

You can ask:

“Are my controls sufficient for this risk?”

“Where are my audit gaps?”

“Is this evidence defensible?”

“Am I ready for SOC 2 Type II?”

The agent evaluates your actual work inside the lab.

Runs entirely in your browser.
No external APIs.
No data transmission.

Practice → Feedback → Refine → Elevate.
