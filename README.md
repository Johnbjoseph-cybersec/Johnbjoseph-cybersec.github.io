**🛡️ GRC Practice Lab
From Theory to Real-World GRC Execution**

A browser-based, hands-on Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) simulation platform designed to help professionals **practice real workflows** — not just study frameworks.

**Built by John B Joseph
Cybersecurity | GRC & AI Governance | ISO/IEC 27001 & 42001 Lead Auditor**

**🌐 Live Lab: https://johnbjoseph-cybersec.github.io/**

**🚀 Why This Exists**

Most GRC learning today is:
Theory-heavy
Certification-focused
Tool-dependent
Not portfolio-ready

You can pass ISO 27001.
You can memorize SOC 2.

But can you build a risk register?
Map controls?
Defend evidence during an audit?

This lab bridges that gap.

**🎯 What This Platform Enables**

Inside the lab, users can:
Build structured Risk Registers
Map Controls to Risks
Generate Statement of Applicability (SoA)
Track Evidence
Simulate Audit Reviews
Run full compliance projects
Visualize Risk Heatmaps
Use an AI-powered GRC Copilot
All directly in the browser.

No backend.
No signup.
No cloud storage.

100% client-side execution.

**⚡ GRC AI Agent (WebGPU + WebLLM Powered)**

Version 3 introduces a fully integrated on-device GRC AI Agent built using:

WebGPU
WebLLM
Local model inference
Embedded knowledge retrieval

The agent can:
Analyze your risk entries
Evaluate control sufficiency
Identify audit gaps
Review evidence defensibility
Assess project readiness

Runs entirely inside your browser.
No external APIs.
No data transmission.

This changes the learning loop:
Practice → Feedback → Refine → Elevate

**🧩 Framework Coverage (480+ Controls)**

Aligned across major standards:

ISO/IEC 27001
