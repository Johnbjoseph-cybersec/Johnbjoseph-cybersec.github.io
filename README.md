## 🚀 Why I Built This

Over the last 3 months, I spoke with **50+ CISOs and GRC leaders**, studied real enterprise workflows, and spent hundreds of hours designing and building this platform.

Most GRC resources today are:

- Theory-heavy  
- Locked behind tools  
- Hidden behind paywalls  
- Not portfolio-friendly  

So I built something practical.

This lab helps you **practice real GRC workflows**, not just read about them.
